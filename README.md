# GO-Notes

#### To start off
```go
    package main

    import ("fmt")

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello World")
    }
```
I am currently learning Go as one of my main languages, currently learnt the syntax from LinkedIn Learning and would like to share some of the notes and mini projects I did while in the course
